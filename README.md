## DESIGN DOC: 

*For 3/3/18 Due Date.*
Our team began with writing a HERA program that converted uppercase to lowercase characters and vice versa, reverse_case.h.cc. We did this using a simple bit mask. This piece of code was very useful when writing putchar.c (our function that takes a character from a terminal and puts it into a register).

After useful discussion with our hardware team, we decided to store the character in R1 and the terminal in R2.
